HelmetJS

This programming course focuses on HelmetJS, a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers. This way it can prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client.

Helmet.js is a Node.js module that helps in securing HTTP headers. It is implemented in express applications. Therefore, we can say that helmet.js helps in securing express applications. It sets up various HTTP headers to prevent attacks like Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS), clickjacking, etc.

Why security of HTTP headers are important: 
	Sometimes developers ignore the HTTP headers. Since HTTP headers can leak sensitive information about the application, therefore, it is important to use the headers in a secure way.

Node-Modules included in Helmet.js are: Helmet.js comes with more built-in modules for increasing the security of the Express application.

	Content-Security-Policy: It sets up the Security Policy.
	Expect-CT: It is used for handling Certificate Transparency.
	X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: It is used for controlling the fetching of browser DNS.
	X-Frame-Options: It is used to prevent ClickJacking.
	X-Powered-By: It is used to remove X-Powered-By header. X-Powered-By header leaks the version of the server and its vendor.
	Public-Key-Pins: It is used for HTTP public key pinning.
	Strict-Transport-Security: It is used for HTTP Strict Transport policy.
	X-Download-Options: It restricts to various Download-Options.
	Cache control: It is used for disabling Client-Side caching.
	X-Content-Type-Options: It is used to prevent the Sniffing attack.
	Referrer-Policy: It is used to hide the referrer header.
	X-XSS-Protection: It is used to add protection to XSS attacks.


How to inspect HTTP Header: 
	For inspecting the header, first right-click on a page that you want to inspect. Now, click on inspect element. After that open the Network tab.

Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

### Hide Potentially Dangerous Information Using helmet.hidePoweredBy()

	Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express. X-Powered-By: Express is sent in every request coming from Express by default. 
		Use the helmet.hidePoweredBy() middleware to remove the X-Powered-By header.

### Mitigate the Risk of Clickjacking with helmet.frameguard()

	Your page could be put in a <frame> or <iframe> without your consent. This can result in clickjacking attacks, among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is. This can be obtained executing your page in a malicious context, by mean of iframing. In that context a hacker can put a hidden layer over your page. Hidden buttons can be used to run bad scripts. This middleware sets the X-Frame-Options header. It restricts who can put your site in a frame. We don’t need our app to be framed. 

	It has three modes: DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM.

		Use helmet.frameguard() passing with the configuration object {action: 'deny'}.

### Mitigate the Risk of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks with helmet.xssFilter()

	Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a frequent type of attack where malicious scripts are injected into vulnerable pages, with the purpose of stealing sensitive data like session cookies, or passwords.

	The basic rule to lower the risk of an XSS attack is simple: “Never trust user’s input”. As a developer you should always sanitize all the input coming from the outside. This includes data coming from forms, GET query urls, and even from POST bodies. Sanitizing means that you should find and encode the characters that may be dangerous e.g. <, >.

	Modern browsers can help mitigating the risk by adopting better software strategies. Often these are configurable via http headers.

	The X-XSS-Protection HTTP header is a basic protection. The browser detects a potential injected script using a heuristic filter. If the header is enabled, the browser changes the script code, neutralizing it. It still has limited support.

		Use helmet.xssFilter() to sanitize input sent to your server.
		
### Avoid Inferring the Response MIME Type with helmet.noSniff()

	Browsers can use content or MIME sniffing to override response Content-Type headers to guess and process the data using an implicit content type. While this can be convenient in some scenarios, it can also lead to some dangerous attacks. This middleware sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to nosniff, instructing the browser to not bypass the provided Content-Type.

		Use the helmet.noSniff() method on your server
		
### Prevent IE from Opening Untrusted HTML with helmet.ieNoOpen()

	Some web applications will serve untrusted HTML for download. Some versions of Internet Explorer by default open those HTML files in the context of your site. This means that an untrusted HTML page could start doing bad things in the context of your pages. This middleware sets the X-Download-Options header to noopen. This will prevent IE users from executing downloads in the trusted site’s context.

		Use the helmet.ieNoOpen() method on your server.
		
		
### Ask Browsers to Access Your Site via HTTPS Only with helmet.hsts()

	HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. If your website can be accessed via HTTPS you can ask user’s browsers to avoid using insecure HTTP. By setting the header Strict-Transport-Security, you tell the browsers to use HTTPS for the future requests in a specified amount of time. This will work for the requests coming after the initial request.

	Configure helmet.hsts() to use HTTPS for the next 90 days. Pass the config object {maxAge: timeInSeconds, force: true}. You can create a variable ninetyDaysInSeconds = 90*24*60*60; to use for the timeInSeconds. Replit already has hsts enabled. To override its settings you need to set the field "force" to true in the config object. We will intercept and restore the Replit header, after inspecting it for testing.

	Note: Configuring HTTPS on a custom website requires the acquisition of a domain, and an SSL/TLS Certificate.
	
	
### Disable DNS Prefetching with helmet.dnsPrefetchControl()

	To improve performance, most browsers prefetch DNS records for the links in a page. In that way the destination ip is already known when the user clicks on a link. This may lead to over-use of the DNS service (if you own a big website, visited by millions people…), privacy issues (one eavesdropper could infer that you are on a certain page), or page statistics alteration (some links may appear visited even if they are not). If you have high security needs you can disable DNS prefetching, at the cost of a performance penalty.

	Use the helmet.dnsPrefetchControl() method on your server.
	
	
### Disable Client-Side Caching with helmet.noCache()

	If you are releasing an update for your website, and you want the users to always download the newer version, you can (try to) disable caching on client’s browser. It can be useful in development too. Caching has performance benefits, which you will lose, so only use this option when there is a real need.

	Use the helmet.noCache() method on your server.
	
	
### Set a Content Security Policy with helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()

	This challenge highlights one promising new defense that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of many type of attacks in modern browsers. By setting and configuring a Content Security Policy you can prevent the injection of anything unintended into your page. This will protect your app from XSS vulnerabilities, undesired tracking, malicious frames, and much more. CSP works by defining an allowed list of content sources which are trusted. You can configure them for each kind of resource a web page may need (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, frames, media, and so on…). There are multiple directives available, so a website owner can have a granular control. See HTML 5 Rocks, KeyCDN for more details. Unfortunately CSP is unsupported by older browser.

	By default, directives are wide open, so it’s important to set the defaultSrc directive as a fallback. Helmet supports both defaultSrc and default-src naming styles. The fallback applies for most of the unspecified directives.

	In this exercise, use helmet.contentSecurityPolicy(). Configure it by adding a directives object. In the object, set the defaultSrc to ["'self'"] (the list of allowed sources must be in an array), in order to trust only your website address by default. Also set the scriptSrc directive so that you only allow scripts to be downloaded from your website ('self'), and from the domain 'trusted-cdn.com'.

	Hint: in the 'self' keyword, the single quotes are part of the keyword itself, so it needs to be enclosed in double quotes to be working.
	
### Configure Helmet Using the ‘parent’ helmet() Middleware

	app.use(helmet()) will automatically include all the middleware introduced above, except noCache(), and contentSecurityPolicy(), but these can be enabled if necessary. You can also disable or configure any other middleware individually, using a configuration object.

	Example:

	app.use(helmet({
	  frameguard: {         // configure
		action: 'deny'
	  },
	  contentSecurityPolicy: {    // enable and configure
		directives: {
		  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
		  styleSrc: ['style.com'],
		}
	  },
	  dnsPrefetchControl: false     // disable
	}))
	
	We introduced each middleware separately for teaching purposes and for ease of testing. 
	Using the ‘parent’ helmet() middleware is easy to implement in a real project.
	
### Understand BCrypt Hashes
	
	BCrypt hashes are very secure. A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into an algorithm and returning a fixed length result. To further complicate this process and make it more secure, you can also salt your hash. Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash.
	
	BCrypt hashes will always look like $2a$13$ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm which does have a structure. 
	The first small bit of data $2a is defining what kind of hash algorithm was used. 
	The next portion $13 defines the cost. Cost is about how much power it takes to compute the hash. It is on a logarithmic scale of 2^cost and determines how many times the data is put through the hashing algorithm. 
	
		For example, at a cost of 10 you are able to hash 10 passwords a second on an average computer, however at a cost of 15 it takes 3 seconds per hash... and to take it further, at a cost of 31 it would take multiple days to complete a hash. A cost of 12 is considered very secure at this time. 
		
	The last portion of your hash $ZyprE5MRw2Q3WpNOGZWGbeG7ADUre1Q8QO.uUUtcbqloU0yvzavOm, looks like one large string of numbers, periods, and letters but it is actually two separate pieces of information. The first 22 characters is the salt in plain text, and the rest is the hashed password!

	Add all your code for these lessons in the server.js file between the code we have started you off with. Do not change or delete the code we have added for you.

	BCrypt has already been added as a dependency, so require it as bcrypt in your server.
	
### Hash and Compare Passwords Asynchronously
	
	As hashing is designed to be computationally intensive, it is recommended to do so asynchronously on your server as to avoid blocking incoming connections while you hash. All you have to do to hash a password asynchronous is call

			bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
			  /*Store hash in your db*/
			});
		
	Add this hashing function to your server (we've already defined the variables used in the function for you to use) and log it to the console for you to see! At this point you would normally save the hash to your database.

	Now when you need to figure out if a new input is the same data as the hash you would just use the compare function.

			bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, (err, res) => {
			  /*res == true or false*/
			});
		
	Add this into your existing hash function (since you need to wait for the hash to complete before calling the compare function) after you log the completed hash and log 'res' to the console within the compare. You should see in the console a hash then 'true' is printed! If you change 'myPlaintextPassword' in the compare function to 'someOtherPlaintextPassword' then it should say false.

			bcrypt.hash('passw0rd!', 13, (err, hash) => {
			  console.log(hash);
			  //$2a$12$Y.PHPE15wR25qrrtgGkiYe2sXo98cjuMCG1YwSI5rJW1DSJp0gEYS
			  bcrypt.compare('passw0rd!', hash, (err, res) => {
				console.log(res); //true
			  });
			});
			
### Hash and Compare Passwords Synchronously

	Hashing synchronously is just as easy to do but can cause lag if using it server side with a high cost or with hashing done very often. Hashing with this method is as easy as calling

	var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);
	
	Add this method of hashing to your code and then log the result to the console. Again, the variables used are already defined in the server so you won't need to adjust them. You may notice even though you are hashing the same password as in the async function, the result in the console is different- this is due to the salt being randomly generated each time as seen by the first 22 characters in the third string of the hash. Now to compare a password input with the new sync hash, you would use the compareSync method:

	var result = bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash);
	with the result being a boolean true or false.

	Add the function in and log the result to the console to see it working.
